# __Title - GMIT Machine Learning and Statistics Repository 2021 - Student Brendan Ryan G00387831__





## __Description - About this Repository__

This is my Repository for the Machine Learning and Statistics Module 2021 and the assignment for that module.

The repository gives an overview and working demos of two of the most popular statistical libraries available in python:
<br/><br/>

### ___Scikit-Learn___

 and 
 

### ___SciPy.stats___

<br/><br/>



 As I am new to Machine Learning / Statistics and don't have a great love for maths! this module and assignment was very challenging. However i enjoyed it none the less and I hope to implement some of the features i learnt in my workplace.

 ### __skit-learn.ipynb__

A Jupyter notebook written in Python code and includes an overview of Skit-learn and demonstrations of the following sckit-learn algorithms

_Categorisation_
- Decision Tree (Decision Tree Classifier)
- Random Forest (Random Forest Classifier)
- Gradient Bossing (Gradient Boosting Classifier)

_Regression_ 
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regression (Decision Tree Regresor)

### __scipy-stats-ipynb__ 

A Jupyter Notebook written in Python code and contains an overview of scipy stats module and demos of common statistical tests

__t-Tests__  

and 

__ANOVA__.

I use two sample datasets for my testing - one is a sample student grades dataset which i downloaded from {} and the other is a sample dataset i extracted from a BI at work which gives details on borrowing habits by demographic(note this dataset does not contain any personal or identifiable information)


Throughout the notebook various plots/images are also included to help the reader visualise the results better.

<br/><br/>

### __Other folders contained within the repository__


- /images/ contains any images used in the notebooks and files
- /datasets/ contains sample datasets used in my notebooks
- /brendan-code/ contains my own test code and lab work

## __Conclusion__

This assignment has given me a great intro to both sckit-learn and scipy stats and I hope you find it intersting.

The Irish Data set is review in sckit learn and is further analysed using some populer categorisation and regression algorithms

The student grades dataset and my own sample work dataset are then analysed using scipy stats using t-Tests and ANOVA

The ANOVA testing on my work dataset proved quiet interesting and sometimes fustrating !! However i feel i have a much better grasp of the concepts and i hope you enjoy reading my findings.
