## Project overview - purpose of Repository

### Scikit-Learn

The file scikit-learn.ipynb gives the user an overvie of the sckit-learn python library. It then gives demonstraions of 3 sckit-learn alogrithms. Plots are also included to help the reader visualise the results better.

The 3 sckit-learn alogrithmes coverd in the demonstations are 

(To be confirmed WIP)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Multuple Linear Regression 


### SciPy Stats

To be completed and updated
